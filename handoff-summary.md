- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Review all API responses to ensure no unintended sensitive data is exposed to the client-side.

**POC Goal**: Demonstrate the Backend-for-Frontend architectural pattern using Next.js API routes to create a secure communication layer between the frontend and backend services, with comprehensive server-side input validation and minimized data exposure.

### State Management & Data Handling POC
- [x] Configure Zustand store for global state management
- [x] Set up TanStack Query client with caching strategies
- [x] Implement React Query dev tools for debugging
- [x] Create data validation layer with Zod (ensure this primarily refers to client-side validation, with server-side being the authoritative source).
- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Ensure all data mutations triggered from the client are subject to robust server-side input validation (as covered in BFF POC) before affecting state or backend systems.
- [ ] Demonstrate optimistic updates pattern
- [x] Build working demo at `/poc/state` showing data flow

**POC Goal**: Establish patterns for state management, data fetching, and validation that can be applied consistently across the application, emphasizing that server-side validation is paramount for security.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Zustand:** A store was created at `lib/stores/appStore.ts` for managing simple global state (e.g., counter, theme) with the `useAppStore` hook for access.
- **TanStack Query:** Configured in `lib/queryClient.ts` with default caching (5-minute `staleTime`, 30-minute `cacheTime`). A `QueryProvider` was set up in `components/custom/query-provider.tsx` and integrated into `app/layout.tsx`, which also enables `ReactQueryDevtools` for debugging.
- **Zod:** Client-side validation is established using Zod schemas, with an example at `lib/schemas/exampleContactSchema.ts`. This schema integrates with React Hook Form (using `@hookform/resolvers/zod`), following patterns demonstrated in `components/custom/form/form-example.tsx` (if available, or as a general pattern). It's important to reiterate that server-side validation remains the critical source of truth for data integrity and security.
- **Demonstration:** A comprehensive demonstration page is available at `/poc/state` showcasing the integration of Zustand for global state, TanStack Query for asynchronous data fetching, and React Hook Form with Zod for client-side form validation.

### Lead Management Mini-App POC
- [ ] Implement lead listing page with pagination and filtering
- [ ] Create lead detail view with related data
- [ ] Build lead creation/edit form with validation
- [ ] Add lead status management workflow
- [ ] Implement basic reporting capabilities
- [ ] Create demo at `/poc/leads` demonstrating end-to-end lead management journey
- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Ensure comprehensive server-side input validation (using Zod) for all API endpoints related to lead management.
- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Perform API endpoint security testing, specifically for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and ensuring correct authorization logic for accessing and modifying lead data.
- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Verify no sensitive data is unnecessarily exposed in lead management UI components or API responses beyond what is required for the user's role and context.

**POC Goal**: Build a small but complete application that integrates all previous POCs to demonstrate a real business workflow, with a strong emphasis on secure data handling, robust server-side validation, and role-based access control to lead data.

### Testing & Quality Assurance Standards
- [x] Set up Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] Configure React Testing Library for component tests (to be used with Vitest)
- [ ] Add Cypress for end-to-end testing (optional)
- [ ] Implement type checking and linting standards
- [ ] Create example tests for each POC module
- Available test scripts: `npm test` (run all tests), `npm run test:ui` (interactive UI), `npm run test:watch` (watch mode).
- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Review any new third-party scripts or services introduced during MVP development for security implications (e.g., supply chain risks, CSP compatibility).
- [ ] **Security Baseline**: Document a basic checklist for security regression testing to be performed before releases.

#### Prioritized Unit Test Implementation

Based on the implemented features and security-first principles, the following unit tests should be implemented in priority order:

**🔴 Priority 1: Security & Authentication (Critical)**
- [ ] `lib/clients/d365Client.ts` - Token acquisition/refresh, error handling, retry mechanism, secure parameter handling

## Development Approach

### Modular POC Approach with Integration Path

After careful consideration, we've decided to pursue focused Proof-of-Concept (POC) modules rather than a single comprehensive prototype. This approach allows for dedicated attention to specific technical challenges, including the systematic integration and verification of security requirements at each stage. It offers several advantages:

- **Focused demonstration** of specific technical challenges
- **Faster validation** of key technologies and patterns (including security controls)
- **Easier team review** of isolated concerns
- **Reduced complexity** in each development cycle
- **Clearer technical boundaries** between components

Each POC will be developed as a standalone module with clear integration points and documentation:

1.  **Core Infrastructure POC**: Dataverse client, token management, error handling, initial security verifications
2.  **Authentication POC**: Complete auth flows, RBAC implementation (D365 integration), session security
3.  **UI Framework POC**: Component system, theming, layouts
4.  **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) POC**: API endpoints, request/response handling, server-side validation
5.  **State Management POC**: Global state, data fetching, caching, secure data flow
6.  **Lead Management Mini-App**: Integration of all previous POCs, end-to-end security validation

Each POC will include:
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Integration documentation
- Consistent patterns and libraries
- Verification of relevant Security Baseline items as defined in the Feature Checklist
- Minimal but sufficient functional test coverage

This approach enables targeted demonstrations while maintaining a clear path to integration when ready to build the comprehensive solution.

### Shared Libraries & Folder Structure

To ensure consistency across POCs and facilitate future integration, we'll follow these conventions:

#### URL/Route Structure
- POC demonstration pages: `/poc/{poc-name}` (e.g., `/poc/auth`, `/poc/ui`, `/poc/state`, `/poc/core`, `/poc/bff`)
- API routes: `/api/{domain}` with HTTP methods (e.g., `GET /api/leads` to list leads, `POST /api/leads` to create)

#### Folder Structure
- `lib/`: Shared utilities and clients
  - `lib/clients/`: API clients (e.g., d365Client.ts)
  - `lib/services/`: Service classes abstracting business logic (e.g., `d365ContactService.ts`)
  - `lib/utils/`: Helper functions (including validation and security utilities)
  - `lib/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `lib/types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `lib/config/`: Configuration (e.g., environment variables, security headers if configured via code)
- `components/`: UI components
  - `components/ui/`: Primitive UI components (from shadcn/ui)
  - `components/custom/`: Domain-specific components (e.g., `poc-navigation.tsx`, `ui-poc-sub-navigation.tsx`)
  - `components/layouts/`: Page layouts and containers
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages and routes
  - `app/api/`: API routes using BFF pattern (e.g., `app/api/bff-poc/items/route.ts`)
  - `app/poc/`: POC demonstration pages (e.g., `app/poc/bff/page.tsx`)
- `styles/`: Global styles and theming
- `middleware.ts`: For handling protected routes and potentially some security headers.

#### Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case for general files (e.g., `error-handler.ts`, `d365-contact-service.ts`)
- Components: PascalCase for component files and functions (e.g., `LeadCard.tsx`)
- Interfaces: Prefixed with "I" (e.g., `ILead`) - *Note: Current BFF POC `Item` interface does not follow this; `AppContactProfile` in `d365ContactService.ts` also does not. Consider for future consistency.*
- Types: PascalCase without prefix (e.g., `LeadStatus`, `UserRole`)
- Environment variables: Uppercase with underscores, prefixed by domain (e.g., `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `DATAVERSE_URL`)

#### Environment Variables
Each POC should document its required environment variables in a `.env.example` file, following this pattern:
```
# Core Infrastructure
DATAVERSE_URL=https://yourtenant.crm.dynamics.com
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
DATAVERSE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
# Field in D365 Contact entity storing Azure AD Object ID (e.g., crXXX_azureadobjectid)
DATAVERSE_CONTACT_AAD_OBJECT_ID_FIELD=yourprefix_azureadobjectidfield
# Field in D365 Contact entity storing application roles (e.g., crXXX_approles, comma-separated string)
DATAVERSE_CONTACT_APP_ROLES_FIELD=yourprefix_applicationrolesfield

# Authentication
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=your-client-secret
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/v2.0
AUTH_SECRET=generate-a-secure-random-string-at-least-32-chars

# App Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

The development of each POC will follow this progression:
1. Backend API implementation (including server-side validation and security considerations from the outset)
2. Data fetching and state management (ensuring secure data flow and handling)
3. UI components and interactions
4. Functional testing, validation, and verification of all applicable Security Baseline items

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated, validated, and confirmed against security requirements.

## Current Focus Area

**Finalizing and Testing Dynamics 365 Integration for Authentication & Authorization POC.**

The current effort involves completing the integration of Dynamics 365 (D365) as the source of truth for user profile information and application-specific roles. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) remains the primary authentication provider.

**Implementation Plan & Progress:**

1.  **Strategy Definition (Completed):** Established a hybrid approach: Azure AD for authentication, D365 for user profiles (Contact records) and application roles. `Auth.js` orchestrates this.
2.  **`D365ContactService` Creation & Configuration (Completed):** Service (`lib/services/d365ContactService.ts`) created and configured to use environment variables for D365 field names.
3.  **`Auth.js` Callback Modifications (Completed):** `jwt` and `session` callbacks in `lib/auth.ts` updated to fetch and integrate D365 contact data.
4.  **Type Augmentation (Completed):** TypeScript declarations for `Session` and `JWT` extended.
5.  **D365 Setup & Environment Configuration (User Confirmed Completed):** Necessary fields in D365 (for AAD Object ID and App Roles) are set up, and local `.env` files are populated with their logical names.
6.  **UI Updated (Completed):** `poc-navigation.tsx` now displays D365 user status and session errors.
7.  **Adapt `mapD365RolesToAppRoles` (Completed):**
    *   The developer has confirmed that the D365 `APP_ROLES_FIELD` uses a comma-separated string format.
    *   The existing `mapD365RolesToAppRoles` method in `lib/services/d365ContactService.ts` correctly handles this format. Other parsing examples remain commented out for future reference.
8.  **Verify `d365Client` Functionality (Initial Verification Completed):**
    *   `lib/clients/d365Client.ts` now initializes correctly in both server and client environments (client-side instance is non-functional by design, preventing crashes related to server-only environment variables).
    *   Further verification of Dataverse API request success will occur during end-to-end testing.

**Next Steps for Auth POC Refinement:**

1.  **Thorough End-to-End Testing (CRITICAL - Current Focus):**
    *   Restart the Next.js application.
    *   Test Case 1: User in AAD & D365 with correctly mapped roles. Verify `session.user` details (including roles and `isD365User: true`).
    *   Test Case 2: User in AAD, not in D365 (or not linked via AAD Object ID). Verify default roles (e.g., `UserRole.USER`) and `session.user.isD365User: false`.
    *   Test Case 3: Different D365 role configurations and error/edge cases (e.g., empty roles field, roles not defined in `UserRole` enum, leading/trailing spaces around roles/commas).
    *   Monitor server-side console logs for debugging messages from `D365ContactService` and `lib/auth.ts`, especially regarding D365 contact lookup and role mapping.
2.  **Implement `updateContactProfile` (Post-Testing):**
    *   Complete the `updateContactProfile` method in `D365ContactService` by ensuring `d365Client.updateContact` is called correctly with the appropriate D365 contact ID and payload.
    *   Create a basic UI (e.g., a simple form on a profile page) and a corresponding API route to allow users to update parts of their D365 profile (e.g., first name, last name) from the portal.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancements (Post-Testing):**
    *   Further update UI components to display more D365-sourced profile information (e.g., on a dedicated profile page or dashboard).
    *   Refine how the application behaves for users with `isD365User: false` (e.g., display a message prompting them to contact support if they expect D365 access).
4.  **Refine Error Handling (Post-Testing):**
    *   Implement more user-friendly display of session errors related to D365 integration (e.g., using toast notifications for `D365LookupFailed` or similar errors surfaced in `session.error`).

*Last updated: 2025-05-11*
