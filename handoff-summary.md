## Development Approach

### Modular POC Approach with Integration Path

After careful consideration, we've decided to pursue focused Proof-of-Concept (POC) modules rather than a single comprehensive prototype. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Focused demonstration** of specific technical challenges
- **Faster validation** of key technologies and patterns
- **Easier team review** of isolated concerns
- **Reduced complexity** in each development cycle
- **Clearer technical boundaries** between components

Each POC will be developed as a standalone module with clear integration points and documentation:

1. **Core Infrastructure POC**: Dataverse client, token management, error handling
2. **Authentication POC**: Complete auth flows, RBAC implementation
3. **UI Framework POC**: Component system, theming, layouts
4. **State Management POC**: Global state, data fetching, caching
5. **Lead Management Mini-App**: Integration of all previous POCs

Each POC will include:
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Integration documentation
- Consistent patterns and libraries
- Minimal but sufficient test coverage

This approach enables targeted demonstrations while maintaining a clear path to integration when ready to build the comprehensive solution.

### Shared Libraries & Folder Structure

To ensure consistency across POCs and facilitate future integration, we'll follow these conventions:

#### URL/Route Structure
- POC demonstration pages: `/poc/{poc-name}` (e.g., `/poc/auth`, `/poc/ui`, `/poc/state`, `/poc/core`)
- API routes: `/api/{domain}/{action}` (e.g., `/api/leads/list`, `/api/auth/roles`)

#### Folder Structure
- `lib/`: Shared utilities and clients
  - `lib/clients/`: API clients (e.g., d365Client.ts)
  - `lib/utils/`: Helper functions
  - `lib/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `lib/types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `lib/config/`: Configuration (e.g., environment variables)
- `components/`: UI components
  - `components/ui/`: Primitive UI components (from shadcn/ui)
  - `components/custom/`: Domain-specific components
  - `components/layouts/`: Page layouts and containers
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages and routes
  - `app/api/`: API routes using BFF pattern
  - `app/(poc)/`: POC demonstration pages
- `styles/`: Global styles and theming

#### Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case for general files (e.g., `error-handler.ts`)
- Components: PascalCase for component files and functions (e.g., `LeadCard.tsx`)
- Interfaces: Prefixed with "I" (e.g., `ILead`)
- Types: PascalCase without prefix (e.g., `LeadStatus`)
- Environment variables: Uppercase with underscores, prefixed by domain (e.g., `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `DATAVERSE_URL`)

#### Environment Variables
Each POC should document its required environment variables in a `.env.example` file, following this pattern:
```
# Core Infrastructure
DATAVERSE_URL=https://yourtenant.crm.dynamics.com
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
DATAVERSE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Authentication
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=your-client-secret
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/v2.0
```

The development of each POC will follow this progression:
1. Backend API implementation
2. Data fetching and state management
3. UI components and interactions
4. Minimal testing and validation

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated.

## Session Planning Guide

This section provides guidance for structuring productive AI conversations to develop each feature area:

### Conversation Structure
1. **Start with Context**: Begin each session by referencing the handoff summary and previous work
2. **Identify Goals**: Clearly specify which feature subset you're targeting in the current session
3. **Establish Requirements**: List specific requirements for the feature being developed
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Discuss approach before diving into code
5. **Code Implementation**: Develop the feature while explaining key decisions
6. **Review & Refine**: Evaluate the implementation against guiding principles
7. **Document**: Update BOTH the Decisions Log and Technical Debt sections for each POC (this is critical for maintaining clear documentation)

### Tips for Effective AI Sessions
- Focus on one conceptual area per conversation
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for features
- Request explanations for complex implementation choices
- Ask for suggestions on alternative approaches
- Reference specific sections of the handoff summary to maintain alignment

## Decisions Log

Use this section to document key architectural and implementation decisions made during development. For each decision, include:

1. The problem or question that prompted the decision
2. Options considered
3. Decision made and rationale
4. Implications for future development

Example:
```
Decision: Token Caching Strategy
Problem: In-memory token caching doesn't work well in serverless environments
Options: 
- Redis caching
- Database storage
- Client-side storage
- Managed service (Azure Key Vault)
Decision: Implemented Azure Key Vault for token caching due to security benefits and Azure integration
Implications: Requires additional Azure configuration but provides better security and scalability
```

### Current Decisions

```
Decision: Development Approach - Modular POCs vs Comprehensive Prototype
Problem: Need to determine whether to build separate POCs or a single comprehensive prototype
Options:
- Build a single comprehensive prototype with all features
- Develop separate, focused POCs for key technical areas
- Create a hybrid approach with interconnected POCs
Decision: Implement focused POC modules with clear integration paths
Rationale: 
- Enables targeted demonstrations of specific technical challenges
- Allows faster validation of key technologies and patterns
- Facilitates easier team review of isolated concerns
- Reduces complexity in each development cycle
- Establishes clearer technical boundaries between components
Implications: 
- Requires careful documentation of integration points
- Needs consistent patterns across POCs to ensure future compatibility
- May require refactoring when integrating POCs into a full solution
```


## Technical Debt Tracking

This section acknowledges shortcuts taken during POC development that would need addressing before production. Each item should include:

1. Description of the current implementation
2. Why it's considered technical debt
3. Potential approach for production-ready solution
4. Priority level (High/Medium/Low)

Example:
```
Item: Hard-coded filter in Dataverse query
Description: Current implementation uses a fixed filter (contains(emailaddress1,'@thecontingent.org'))
Why it's debt: Not configurable for multi-tenant usage and prevents proper filtering
Production approach: Implement configurable filters based on tenant settings and user inputs
Priority: High
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action Items

1. **Complete Core Infrastructure POC**:
   - Implement the d365Client.ts class with proper token management
   - Move token caching logic from API route to client
