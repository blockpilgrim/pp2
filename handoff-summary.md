# Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0 Handoff Summary

## Project Overview

This document serves as a guide for incremental development of the Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0. It provides a high-level overview of the project goals, guiding principles, and a checklist of features to implement.

### Purpose

The Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0 aims to replace the previous Power Pages implementation with a more scalable, maintainable, and customizable solution using modern web technologies. This rebuild addresses limitations in the previous version and aligns with multi-state expansion plans.

### Guiding Principles

- **Security**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Stability**: Build reliable, predictable, and fault-tolerant systems
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and multi-state expansion
- **Maintainability**: Create clean, documented, and modular code
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build code that's accessible across all experience levels
- **Clarity**: Develop intuitive interfaces and clear code patterns
- **Simplicity**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Modern Best Practices**: Utilize current industry standards and patterns

## Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js App Router with React Server Components and Client Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Hook Form for forms
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with Azure AD
- **Backend Integration**: Backend-for-Frontend pattern via Next.js API Routes
- **Data Handling**: TanStack Query (React Query v5) for data fetching and caching
- **Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps with CI/CD via Azure DevOps

## Feature Checklist

This checklist will be updated throughout the development process to track progress. Features are grouped by conversation complexity (what can reasonably be accomplished in a single AI session) and include dependency tags where applicable.

**Conversation Scope**: Add business intelligence features that allow users to analyze and export lead data.

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality Assurance [Ongoing]
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests
- [ ] Configure linting and code quality tools

**Minimal Testing Requirements per POC**: Each POC should include at least basic unit tests for critical functionality and TypeScript type checking throughout.

### ðŸš€ Deployment & DevOps [Final Conversation]
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure staging and production environments
- [ ] Implement monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create documentation for deployment

**Conversation Scope**: Prepare the application for production deployment with proper DevOps practices.

## Development Approach

The development will proceed in an incremental, feature-by-feature approach. Each feature will be built out completely before moving to the next, including:

1. Backend API implementation
2. Data fetching and state management
3. UI components and interactions
4. Minimal testing and validation

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated.

## Session Planning Guide

This section provides guidance for structuring productive AI conversations to develop each feature area:

### Conversation Structure
1. **Start with Context**: Begin each session by referencing the handoff summary and previous work
2. **Identify Goals**: Clearly specify which feature subset you're targeting in the current session
3. **Establish Requirements**: List specific requirements for the feature being developed
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Discuss approach before diving into code
5. **Code Implementation**: Develop the feature while explaining key decisions
6. **Review & Refine**: Evaluate the implementation against guiding principles
7. **Document**: Update the Decisions Log and Technical Debt sections

### Tips for Effective AI Sessions
- Focus on one conceptual area per conversation
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for features
- Request explanations for complex implementation choices
- Ask for suggestions on alternative approaches
- Reference specific sections of the handoff summary to maintain alignment

## Decisions Log

Use this section to document key architectural and implementation decisions made during development. For each decision, include:

1. The problem or question that prompted the decision
2. Options considered
3. Decision made and rationale
4. Implications for future development

Example:
```
Decision: Token Caching Strategy
Problem: In-memory token caching doesn't work well in serverless environments
Options: 
- Redis caching
- Database storage
- Client-side storage
- Managed service (Azure Key Vault)
Decision: Implemented Azure Key Vault for token caching due to security benefits and Azure integration
Implications: Requires additional Azure configuration but provides better security and scalability
```

## Technical Debt Tracking

This section acknowledges shortcuts taken during POC development that would need addressing before production. Each item should include:

1. Description of the current implementation
2. Why it's considered technical debt
3. Potential approach for production-ready solution
4. Priority level (High/Medium/Low)

Example:
```
Item: Hard-coded filter in Dataverse query
Description: Current implementation uses a fixed filter (contains(emailaddress1,'@thecontingent.org'))
Why it's debt: Not configurable for multi-tenant usage and prevents proper filtering
Production approach: Implement configurable filters based on tenant settings and user inputs
Priority: High
```

## Next Steps

Start with the Core Infrastructure items in Conversation 1, as they form the foundation for all other features. Then proceed to Authentication & Authorization to ensure secure access to the application.
