## Development Approach

### Modular POC Approach with Integration Path

After careful consideration, we've decided to pursue focused Proof-of-Concept (POC) modules rather than a single comprehensive prototype. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Focused demonstration** of specific technical challenges
- **Faster validation** of key technologies and patterns
- **Easier team review** of isolated concerns
- **Reduced complexity** in each development cycle
- **Clearer technical boundaries** between components

Each POC will be developed as a standalone module with clear integration points and documentation:

1. **Core Infrastructure POC**: Dataverse client, token management, error handling
2. **Authentication POC**: Complete auth flows, RBAC implementation
3. **UI Framework POC**: Component system, theming, layouts
4. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) POC**: API endpoints, request/response handling
5. **State Management POC**: Global state, data fetching, caching
6. **Lead Management Mini-App**: Integration of all previous POCs

Each POC will include:
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Integration documentation
- Consistent patterns and libraries
- Minimal but sufficient test coverage

This approach enables targeted demonstrations while maintaining a clear path to integration when ready to build the comprehensive solution.

### Shared Libraries & Folder Structure

To ensure consistency across POCs and facilitate future integration, we'll follow these conventions:

#### URL/Route Structure
- POC demonstration pages: `/poc/{poc-name}` (e.g., `/poc/auth`, `/poc/ui`, `/poc/state`, `/poc/core`)
- API routes: `/api/{domain}/{action}` (e.g., `/api/leads/list`, `/api/auth/roles`)

#### Folder Structure
- `lib/`: Shared utilities and clients
  - `lib/clients/`: API clients (e.g., d365Client.ts)
  - `lib/utils/`: Helper functions
  - `lib/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `lib/types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `lib/config/`: Configuration (e.g., environment variables)
- `components/`: UI components
  - `components/ui/`: Primitive UI components (from shadcn/ui)
  - `components/custom/`: Domain-specific components
  - `components/layouts/`: Page layouts and containers
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages and routes
  - `app/api/`: API routes using BFF pattern
  - `app/poc/`: POC demonstration pages
- `styles/`: Global styles and theming

#### Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case for general files (e.g., `error-handler.ts`)
- Components: PascalCase for component files and functions (e.g., `LeadCard.tsx`)
- Interfaces: Prefixed with "I" (e.g., `ILead`)
- Types: PascalCase without prefix (e.g., `LeadStatus`)
- Environment variables: Uppercase with underscores, prefixed by domain (e.g., `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `DATAVERSE_URL`)

#### Environment Variables
Each POC should document its required environment variables in a `.env.example` file, following this pattern:
```
# Core Infrastructure
DATAVERSE_URL=https://yourtenant.crm.dynamics.com
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
DATAVERSE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Authentication
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=your-client-secret
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/v2.0
```

The development of each POC will follow this progression:
1. Backend API implementation
2. Data fetching and state management
3. UI components and interactions
4. Minimal testing and validation

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated.

## Session Planning Guide

This section provides guidance for structuring productive AI conversations to develop each feature area:

### Conversation Structure
1. **Start with Context**: Begin each session by referencing the handoff summary and previous work
2. **Identify Goals**: Clearly specify which feature subset you're targeting in the current session
3. **Establish Requirements**: List specific requirements for the feature being developed
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Discuss approach before diving into code
5. **Code Implementation**: Develop the feature while explaining key decisions
6. **Review & Refine**: Evaluate the implementation against guiding principles
7. **Document**: Update BOTH the Decisions Log and Technical Debt sections for each POC (this is critical for maintaining clear documentation)

### Tips for Effective AI Sessions
- Focus on one conceptual area per conversation
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for features
- Request explanations for complex implementation choices
- Ask for suggestions on alternative approaches
- Reference specific sections of the handoff summary to maintain alignment

## Decisions Log

Use this section to document key architectural and implementation decisions made during development. For each decision, include:

1. The problem or question that prompted the decision
2. Options considered
3. Decision made and rationale
4. Implications for future development

Example:
```
Decision: Token Caching Strategy
Problem: In-memory token caching doesn't work well in serverless environments
Options: 
- Redis caching
- Database storage
- Client-side storage
- Managed service (Azure Key Vault)
Decision: Implemented Azure Key Vault for token caching due to security benefits and Azure integration
Implications: Requires additional Azure configuration but provides better security and scalability
```

### Current Decisions

```
Decision: Development Approach - Modular POCs vs Comprehensive Prototype
Problem: Need to determine whether to build separate POCs or a single comprehensive prototype
Options:
- Build a single comprehensive prototype with all features
- Develop separate, focused POCs for key technical areas
- Create a hybrid approach with interconnected POCs
Decision: Implement focused POC modules with clear integration paths
Rationale: 
- Enables targeted demonstrations of specific technical challenges
- Allows faster validation of key technologies and patterns
- Facilitates easier team review of isolated concerns
- Reduces complexity in each development cycle
- Establishes clearer technical boundaries between components
Implications: 
- Requires careful documentation of integration points
- Needs consistent patterns across POCs to ensure future compatibility
- May require refactoring when integrating POCs into a full solution
```

```
Decision: Token Caching Strategy for Core Infrastructure POC
Problem: Need an efficient way to cache Dataverse API tokens to reduce authentication overhead
Options:
- In-memory caching
- Redis caching
- Database storage
- Azure Key Vault
Decision: Implemented in-memory token caching for POC with clear path to production alternatives
Rationale:
- Simple to implement for demonstration purposes
- Sufficient for development environment
- Clearly documented limitations and production alternatives
Implications:
- Will need to be replaced with Redis or Azure Key Vault in production
- Provides a clean abstraction that can be swapped without changing consumer code
```

```
Decision: Error Handling Pattern
Problem: Need consistent error handling across API routes and client code
Options:
- Ad-hoc error handling in each route
- Generic error middleware
- Centralized error utility functions with typed errors
Decision: Implemented centralized error utilities with typed errors
Rationale:
- Provides consistent error responses across all API routes
- Makes error handling more predictable for frontend code
- Type safety helps prevent errors during development
Implications:
- All API routes should use the error handling utilities
- Frontend code can rely on consistent error structure
```

```
Decision: Environment Variable Validation
Problem: Need to ensure all required environment variables are present and valid
Options:
- Manual validation in application code
- Simple existence checks
- Schema-based validation with Zod
Decision: Implemented Zod schema validation for environment variables
Rationale:
- Provides type safety and runtime validation
- Clear error messages when configuration is missing or invalid
- Separates validation concerns from application logic
Implications:
- All environment access should go through the validated config
- Makes configuration requirements explicit and self-documenting
```

```
Decision: URL Structure and Folder Organization
Problem: The project had an inconsistency between URL structure in documentation and actual implementation
Options:
- Continue using the app/(poc) route group (URLs like /auth-test)
- Follow the documentation and use app/poc/* (URLs like /poc/auth-test)
- Introduce a new structure entirely
Decision: Standardized on app/poc/* to follow documentation specification
Rationale:
- Aligns implementation with documented URL pattern (/poc/*)
- Creates consistency between documentation and code
- Follows Next.js routing conventions more clearly
Implications:
- Provides clearer understanding of URL structure
- Makes it easier to navigate the codebase by having consistent naming
- Avoids confusion for future developers
```

```
Decision: Directory Structure and API Route Patterns Alignment
Problem: Project structure didn't fully align with the documented folder structure and API route patterns
Options:
- Keep the existing structure with d365Client in lib/ and API under /api/core/dataverse
- Reorganize to match documentation with d365Client in lib/clients/ and API under /api/dataverse
- Create a hybrid approach with partial reorganization
Decision: Fully align with documented structure
Rationale:
- Creates consistency between documentation and implementation
- Follows established naming conventions and directory structure
- Improves maintainability by making the codebase predictable
- Adheres to the guiding principles of clarity and maintainability
Implications:
- Requires updating imports across the codebase
- May initially break existing routes if not all references are updated
- Establishes a pattern for future code organization
```

```
Decision: POC Directory Naming Standardization
Problem: POC directory names in app/poc/* had inconsistent naming patterns (auth-test, bff-test, styling-test)
Options:
- Keep existing inconsistent naming (auth-test, bff-test, styling-test)
- Standardize on cleaner names without the "-test" suffix (auth, bff, ui)
- Adopt a completely different naming convention
Decision: Standardize on cleaner POC names without the "-test" suffix
Rationale:
- Creates consistency with documentation which references /poc/auth, /poc/ui, etc.
- Makes URLs cleaner and more professional (e.g., /poc/ui instead of /poc/styling-test)
- Establishes a consistent pattern for future POCs (state, leads)
- Better represents the purpose of each POC as a concept demonstration, not just a test
Implications:
- Required updating references in navigation and documentation
- Simplified the URL structure for better usability
- Helps clarify that these are proper Proof-of-Concept modules, not just test pages
```

## Technical Debt Tracking

This section acknowledges shortcuts taken during POC development that would need addressing before production. Each item should include:

1. Description of the current implementation
2. Why it's considered technical debt
3. Potential approach for production-ready solution
4. Priority level (High/Medium/Low)

Example:
```
Item: Hard-coded filter in Dataverse query
Description: Current implementation uses a fixed filter (contains(emailaddress1,'@thecontingent.org'))
Why it's debt: Not configurable for multi-tenant usage and prevents proper filtering
Production approach: Implement configurable filters based on tenant settings and user inputs
Priority: High
```

### Current Technical Debt

```
Item: In-memory token caching
Description: Core Infrastructure POC uses simple in-memory caching for Dataverse tokens
Why it's debt: In-memory caching doesn't persist across serverless function invocations
Production approach: Replace with Redis cache or Azure Key Vault for token storage
Priority: Medium
```

```
Item: Limited error reporting
Description: Errors are logged to console but not captured in a monitoring system
Why it's debt: Makes it difficult to track and respond to production issues
Production approach: Integrate with application monitoring service (e.g., Application Insights)
Priority: Medium
```

```
Item: Missing comprehensive test coverage
Description: POCs have minimal or no automated tests
Why it's debt: Increases risk of regressions and makes changes more difficult
Production approach: Implement comprehensive test suite with Jest and React Testing Library
Priority: High
```
