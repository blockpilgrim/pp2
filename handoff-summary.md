# Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0 Handoff Summary

## Project Overview

This document serves as a guide for incremental development of the Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0. It provides a high-level overview of the project goals, guiding principles, and a checklist of features to implement.

### Purpose

The Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0 aims to replace the previous Power Pages implementation with a more scalable, maintainable, and customizable solution using modern web technologies. This rebuild addresses limitations in the previous version and aligns with multi-state expansion plans.

### Guiding Principles

- **Security**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Stability**: Build reliable, predictable, and fault-tolerant systems
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and multi-state expansion
- **Maintainability**: Create clean, documented, and modular code
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build code that's accessible across all experience levels
- **Clarity**: Develop intuitive interfaces and clear code patterns
- **Simplicity**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Modern Best Practices**: Utilize current industry standards and patterns

## Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js App Router with React Server Components and Client Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Hook Form for forms
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with Azure AD
- **Backend Integration**: Backend-for-Frontend pattern via Next.js API Routes
- **Data Handling**: TanStack Query (React Query v5) for data fetching and caching
- **Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps with CI/CD via Azure DevOps

## Development Approach

### Modular POC Approach with Integration Path

After careful consideration, we've decided to pursue focused Proof-of-Concept (POC) modules rather than a single comprehensive prototype. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Focused demonstration** of specific technical challenges
- **Faster validation** of key technologies and patterns
- **Easier team review** of isolated concerns
- **Reduced complexity** in each development cycle
- **Clearer technical boundaries** between components

Each POC will be developed as a standalone module with clear integration points and documentation:

1. **Core Infrastructure POC**: Dataverse client, token management, error handling
2. **Authentication POC**: Complete auth flows, RBAC implementation
3. **UI Framework POC**: Component system, theming, layouts
4. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) POC**: API endpoints, request/response handling
5. **State Management POC**: Global state, data fetching, caching
6. **Lead Management Mini-App**: Integration of all previous POCs

Each POC will include:
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Integration documentation
- Consistent patterns and libraries
- Minimal but sufficient test coverage

This approach enables targeted demonstrations while maintaining a clear path to integration when ready to build the comprehensive solution.

### Shared Libraries & Folder Structure

To ensure consistency across POCs and facilitate future integration, we'll follow these conventions:

#### URL/Route Structure
- POC demonstration pages: `/poc/{poc-name}` (e.g., `/poc/auth`, `/poc/ui`, `/poc/state`, `/poc/core`)
- API routes: `/api/{domain}` with HTTP methods (e.g., `GET /api/leads` to list leads, `POST /api/leads` to create)

#### Folder Structure
- `lib/`: Shared utilities and clients
  - `lib/clients/`: API clients (e.g., d365Client.ts)
  - `lib/utils/`: Helper functions
  - `lib/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `lib/types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `lib/config/`: Configuration (e.g., environment variables)
- `components/`: UI components
  - `components/ui/`: Primitive UI components (from shadcn/ui)
  - `components/custom/`: Domain-specific components
  - `components/layouts/`: Page layouts and containers
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages and routes
  - `app/api/`: API routes using BFF pattern
  - `app/poc/`: POC demonstration pages
- `styles/`: Global styles and theming

#### Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case for general files (e.g., `error-handler.ts`)
- Components: PascalCase for component files and functions (e.g., `LeadCard.tsx`)
- Interfaces: Prefixed with "I" (e.g., `ILead`)
- Types: PascalCase without prefix (e.g., `LeadStatus`)
- Environment variables: Uppercase with underscores, prefixed by domain (e.g., `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `DATAVERSE_URL`)

#### Environment Variables
Each POC should document its required environment variables in a `.env.example` file, following this pattern:
```
# Core Infrastructure
DATAVERSE_URL=https://yourtenant.crm.dynamics.com
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
DATAVERSE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Authentication
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=your-client-secret
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/v2.0
```

The development of each POC will follow this progression:
1. Backend API implementation
2. Data fetching and state management
3. UI components and interactions
4. Minimal testing and validation

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated.

## Session Planning Guide

This section provides guidance for structuring productive AI conversations to develop each feature area:

### Conversation Structure
1. **Start with Context**: Begin each session by referencing the handoff summary and previous work
2. **Identify Goals**: Clearly specify which feature subset you're targeting in the current session
3. **Establish Requirements**: List specific requirements for the feature being developed
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Discuss approach before diving into code
5. **Code Implementation**: Develop the feature while explaining key decisions
6. **Review & Refine**: Evaluate the implementation against guiding principles
7. **Document**: Update BOTH the Decisions Log (./decisions-log.md) and Technical Debt document (./technical-debt.md) when completing a POC (this is critical for maintaining clear documentation)

### Tips for Effective AI Sessions
- Focus on one conceptual area per conversation
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for features
- Request explanations for complex implementation choices
- Ask for suggestions on alternative approaches
- Reference specific sections of the handoff summary to maintain alignment

## Project References

### Key References

- [Decisions Log](./decisions-log.md) - Documentation of architectural and implementation decisions
- [Technical Debt Tracking](./technical-debt.md) - Known technical debt items and remediation plans

These files are separated from the main handoff summary to optimize context window usage during AI pairing sessions. Reference them as needed for detailed architectural discussions or when addressing technical debt.
