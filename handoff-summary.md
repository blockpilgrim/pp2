# Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0 Handoff Summary

## Project Overview

This document serves as a guide for incremental development of the Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0. It provides a high-level overview of the project goals, guiding principles, and a checklist of features to implement.

### Purpose

The Partner Lead Management Portal V2.0 aims to replace the previous Power Pages implementation with a more scalable, maintainable, and customizable solution using modern web technologies. This rebuild addresses limitations in the previous version and aligns with multi-state expansion plans.

### Guiding Principles

- **Security**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Stability**: Build reliable, predictable, and fault-tolerant systems
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and multi-state expansion
- **Maintainability**: Create clean, documented, and modular code
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build code that's accessible across all experience levels
- **Clarity**: Develop intuitive interfaces and clear code patterns
- **Simplicity**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Modern Best Practices**: Utilize current industry standards and patterns

## Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js App Router with React Server Components and Client Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Hook Form for forms
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with Azure AD
- **Backend Integration**: Backend-for-Frontend pattern via Next.js API Routes
- **Data Handling**: TanStack Query (React Query v5) for data fetching and caching
- **Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps with CI/CD via Azure DevOps

## Feature Checklist

This checklist will be updated throughout the development process to track progress.

## Development Approach

The development will proceed in an incremental, feature-by-feature approach. Each feature will be built out completely before moving to the next, including:

1. Backend API implementation
2. Data fetching and state management
3. UI components and interactions
4. Testing and validation

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated.

## Next Steps

Start with the Core Infrastructure items, as they form the foundation for all other features. Then proceed to Authentication & Authorization to ensure secure access to the application.
