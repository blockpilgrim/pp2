## Development Approach

### Modular POC Approach with Integration Path

After careful consideration, we've decided to pursue focused Proof-of-Concept (POC) modules rather than a single comprehensive prototype. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Focused demonstration** of specific technical challenges
- **Faster validation** of key technologies and patterns
- **Easier team review** of isolated concerns
- **Reduced complexity** in each development cycle
- **Clearer technical boundaries** between components

Each POC will be developed as a standalone module with clear integration points and documentation:

1. **Core Infrastructure POC**: Dataverse client, token management, error handling
2. **Authentication POC**: Complete auth flows, RBAC implementation (D365 integration)
3. **UI Framework POC**: Component system, theming, layouts
4. **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) POC**: API endpoints, request/response handling
5. **State Management POC**: Global state, data fetching, caching
6. **Lead Management Mini-App**: Integration of all previous POCs

Each POC will include:
- Independent deployment capabilities
- Integration documentation
- Consistent patterns and libraries
- Minimal but sufficient test coverage

This approach enables targeted demonstrations while maintaining a clear path to integration when ready to build the comprehensive solution.

### Shared Libraries & Folder Structure

To ensure consistency across POCs and facilitate future integration, we'll follow these conventions:

#### URL/Route Structure
- POC demonstration pages: `/poc/{poc-name}` (e.g., `/poc/auth`, `/poc/ui`, `/poc/state`, `/poc/core`, `/poc/bff`)
- API routes: `/api/{domain}` with HTTP methods (e.g., `GET /api/leads` to list leads, `POST /api/leads` to create)

#### Folder Structure
- `lib/`: Shared utilities and clients
  - `lib/clients/`: API clients (e.g., d365Client.ts)
  - `lib/services/`: Service classes abstracting business logic (e.g., `d365ContactService.ts`)
  - `lib/utils/`: Helper functions
  - `lib/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `lib/types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `lib/config/`: Configuration (e.g., environment variables)
- `components/`: UI components
  - `components/ui/`: Primitive UI components (from shadcn/ui)
  - `components/custom/`: Domain-specific components (e.g., `poc-navigation.tsx`, `ui-poc-sub-navigation.tsx`)
  - `components/layouts/`: Page layouts and containers
- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages and routes
  - `app/api/`: API routes using BFF pattern (e.g., `app/api/bff-poc/items/route.ts`)
  - `app/poc/`: POC demonstration pages (e.g., `app/poc/bff/page.tsx`)
- `styles/`: Global styles and theming

#### Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case for general files (e.g., `error-handler.ts`, `d365-contact-service.ts`)
- Components: PascalCase for component files and functions (e.g., `LeadCard.tsx`)
- Interfaces: Prefixed with "I" (e.g., `ILead`) - *Note: Current BFF POC `Item` interface does not follow this; `AppContactProfile` in `d365ContactService.ts` also does not. Consider for future consistency.*
- Types: PascalCase without prefix (e.g., `LeadStatus`, `UserRole`)
- Environment variables: Uppercase with underscores, prefixed by domain (e.g., `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `DATAVERSE_URL`)

#### Environment Variables
Each POC should document its required environment variables in a `.env.example` file, following this pattern:
```
# Core Infrastructure
DATAVERSE_URL=https://yourtenant.crm.dynamics.com
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
DATAVERSE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
DATAVERSE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
# Field in D365 Contact entity storing Azure AD Object ID (e.g., crXXX_azureadobjectid)
DATAVERSE_CONTACT_AAD_OBJECT_ID_FIELD=yourprefix_azureadobjectidfield
# Field in D365 Contact entity storing application roles (e.g., crXXX_approles, comma-separated string)
DATAVERSE_CONTACT_APP_ROLES_FIELD=yourprefix_applicationrolesfield

# Authentication
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID=your-client-id
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET=your-client-secret
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/v2.0
AUTH_SECRET=generate-a-secure-random-string-at-least-32-chars

# App Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

The development of each POC will follow this progression:
1. Backend API implementation
2. Data fetching and state management
3. UI components and interactions
4. Minimal testing and validation

This methodical approach ensures that at each stage, we have working functionality that can be demonstrated and validated.

## Session Planning Guide

This section provides guidance for structuring productive AI conversations to develop each feature area:

### Conversation Structure
1. **Start with Context**: Begin each session by referencing the handoff summary and previous work
2. **Identify Goals**: Clearly specify which feature subset you're targeting in the current session
3. **Establish Requirements**: List specific requirements for the feature being developed
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Discuss approach before diving into code
5. **Code Implementation**: Develop the feature while explaining key decisions
6. **Review & Refine**: Evaluate the implementation against guiding principles
7. **Document**: Update BOTH the Decisions Log (./decisions-log.md) and Technical Debt document (./technical-debt.md) when completing a POC (this is critical for maintaining clear documentation)

### Tips for Effective AI Sessions
- Focus on one conceptual area per conversation
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for features
- Request explanations for complex implementation choices
- Ask for suggestions on alternative approaches
- Reference specific sections of the handoff summary to maintain alignment

## Project References

### Key References

- [Decisions Log](./decisions-log.md) - Documentation of architectural and implementation decisions
- [Technical Debt Tracking](./technical-debt.md) - Known technical debt items and remediation plans

These files are separated from the main handoff summary to optimize context window usage during AI pairing sessions. Reference them as needed for detailed architectural discussions or when addressing technical debt.

## Current Focus Area

Theme refinements

<!-- **Finalizing and Testing Dynamics 365 Integration for Authentication & Authorization POC.**

The current effort involves completing the integration of Dynamics 365 (D365) as the source of truth for user profile information and application-specific roles. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) remains the primary authentication provider.

**Implementation Plan & Progress:**

1.  **Strategy Definition (Completed):** Established a hybrid approach: Azure AD for authentication, D365 for user profiles (Contact records) and application roles. `Auth.js` orchestrates this.
2.  **`D365ContactService` Creation & Configuration (Completed):** Service (`lib/services/d365ContactService.ts`) created and configured to use environment variables for D365 field names.
3.  **`Auth.js` Callback Modifications (Completed):** `jwt` and `session` callbacks in `lib/auth.ts` updated to fetch and integrate D365 contact data.
4.  **Type Augmentation (Completed):** TypeScript declarations for `Session` and `JWT` extended.
5.  **D365 Setup & Environment Configuration (User Confirmed Completed):** Necessary fields in D365 (for AAD Object ID and App Roles) are set up, and local `.env` files are populated with their logical names.
6.  **UI Updated (Completed):** `poc-navigation.tsx` now displays D365 user status and session errors.
7.  **Adapt `mapD365RolesToAppRoles` (Completed):**
    *   The developer has confirmed that the D365 `APP_ROLES_FIELD` uses a comma-separated string format.
    *   The existing `mapD365RolesToAppRoles` method in `lib/services/d365ContactService.ts` correctly handles this format. Other parsing examples remain commented out for future reference.
8.  **Verify `d365Client` Functionality (Initial Verification Completed):**
    *   `lib/clients/d365Client.ts` now initializes correctly in both server and client environments (client-side instance is non-functional by design, preventing crashes related to server-only environment variables).
    *   Further verification of Dataverse API request success will occur during end-to-end testing.

**Next Steps for Auth POC Refinement:**

1.  **Thorough End-to-End Testing (CRITICAL - Current Focus):**
    *   Restart the Next.js application.
    *   Test Case 1: User in AAD & D365 with correctly mapped roles. Verify `session.user` details (including roles and `isD365User: true`).
    *   Test Case 2: User in AAD, not in D365 (or not linked via AAD Object ID). Verify default roles (e.g., `UserRole.USER`) and `session.user.isD365User: false`.
    *   Test Case 3: Different D365 role configurations and error/edge cases (e.g., empty roles field, roles not defined in `UserRole` enum, leading/trailing spaces around roles/commas).
    *   Monitor server-side console logs for debugging messages from `D365ContactService` and `lib/auth.ts`, especially regarding D365 contact lookup and role mapping.
2.  **Implement `updateContactProfile` (Post-Testing):**
    *   Complete the `updateContactProfile` method in `D365ContactService` by ensuring `d365Client.updateContact` is called correctly with the appropriate D365 contact ID and payload.
    *   Create a basic UI (e.g., a simple form on a profile page) and a corresponding API route to allow users to update parts of their D365 profile (e.g., first name, last name) from the portal.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancements (Post-Testing):**
    *   Further update UI components to display more D365-sourced profile information (e.g., on a dedicated profile page or dashboard).
    *   Refine how the application behaves for users with `isD365User: false` (e.g., display a message prompting them to contact support if they expect D365 access).
4.  **Refine Error Handling (Post-Testing):**
    *   Implement more user-friendly display of session errors related to D365 integration (e.g., using toast notifications for `D365LookupFailed` or similar errors surfaced in `session.error`).
