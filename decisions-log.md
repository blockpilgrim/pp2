## Decisions

```
Decision: Removal of Core Infrastructure POC Page and API Route
Problem: The `/poc/core` page and its associated API route (`/api/dataverse/test`) were created to demonstrate basic Dataverse client connectivity. This functionality became redundant as more comprehensive Dataverse interactions were implemented within the Authentication/Authorization POC (user profile fetching) and planned for the Profile page.
Options:
- Keep the `/poc/core` page as a standalone, simple test utility.
- Refactor `/poc/core` to demonstrate more advanced Dataverse features.
- Remove `/poc/core` and its API route to simplify the project and eliminate redundancy.
Decision: Remove the `/poc/core` page and the `/api/dataverse/test` API route.
Rationale:
- Simplicity: Aligns with the guiding principle of favoring straightforward solutions and reducing complexity.
- Redundancy: The core purpose (testing Dataverse connection) is covered by other, more functional parts of the application (e.g., user login, profile page).
- Maintainability: Reduces the amount of code to maintain and test.
- Clarity: Streamlines the POCs to focus on distinct, non-overlapping concerns.
Implications:
- The `project-charter.md` was updated to reflect this change.
- Navigation links to `/poc/core` were removed from `poc-navigation.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`.
- The `app/poc/core` directory and `app/api/dataverse/test` directory were deleted.
- Future demonstrations of Dataverse client capabilities will rely on the Authentication POC, Profile page, and other feature-specific implementations.
```


```
Decision: Development Approach - Modular POCs vs Comprehensive Prototype
Problem: Need to determine whether to build separate POCs or a single comprehensive prototype
Options:
- Build a single comprehensive prototype with all features
- Develop separate, focused POCs for key technical areas
- Create a hybrid approach with interconnected POCs
Decision: Implement focused POC modules with clear integration paths
Rationale: 
- Enables targeted demonstrations of specific technical challenges
- Allows faster validation of key technologies and patterns
- Facilitates easier team review of isolated concerns
- Reduces complexity in each development cycle
- Establishes clearer technical boundaries between components
Implications: 
- Requires careful documentation of integration points
- Needs consistent patterns across POCs to ensure future compatibility
- May require refactoring when integrating POCs into a full solution
```

```
Decision: Authentication Flow and Session Management
Problem: Need a secure and user-friendly authentication approach for the Partner Portal
Options:
- Simple JWT-based authentication with basic session management
- Enhanced authentication with role-based access controls and middleware protection
- Third-party identity provider integration with full session management
Decision: Implemented comprehensive Auth.js (NextAuth v5) solution with Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control
Rationale:
- Provides enterprise-grade security with Microsoft Entra ID integration
- Implements robust RBAC model that can be extended as the application grows
- Uses middleware for route protection, offering both security and flexibility
- Creates reusable patterns for auth-related UI components
- Implements session monitoring and token refresh capabilities
Implications:
- Requires proper configuration of Microsoft Entra ID in all environments
- Authentication flow must be carefully managed to prevent issues across environments
- Role assignments will need to be sourced from an external system in production
```

```
Decision: Token Caching Strategy for Core Infrastructure POC
Problem: Need an efficient way to cache Dataverse API tokens to reduce authentication overhead
Options:
- In-memory caching
- Redis caching
- Database storage
- Azure Key Vault
Decision: Implemented in-memory token caching for POC with clear path to production alternatives
Rationale:
- Simple to implement for demonstration purposes
- Sufficient for development environment
- Clearly documented limitations and production alternatives
Implications:
- Will need to be replaced with Redis or Azure Key Vault in production
- Provides a clean abstraction that can be swapped without changing consumer code
```

```
Decision: Error Handling Pattern
Problem: Need consistent error handling across API routes and client code
Options:
- Ad-hoc error handling in each route
- Generic error middleware
- Centralized error utility functions with typed errors
Decision: Implemented centralized error utilities with typed errors
Rationale:
- Provides consistent error responses across all API routes
- Makes error handling more predictable for frontend code
- Type safety helps prevent errors during development
Implications:
- All API routes should use the error handling utilities
- Frontend code can rely on consistent error structure
```

```
Decision: Environment Variable Validation
Problem: Need to ensure all required environment variables are present and valid
Options:
- Manual validation in application code
- Simple existence checks
- Schema-based validation with Zod
Decision: Implemented Zod schema validation for environment variables
Rationale:
- Provides type safety and runtime validation
- Clear error messages when configuration is missing or invalid
- Separates validation concerns from application logic
Implications:
- All environment access should go through the validated config
- Makes configuration requirements explicit and self-documenting
```

```
Decision: URL Structure and Folder Organization
Problem: The project had an inconsistency between URL structure in documentation and actual implementation
Options:
- Continue using the app/(poc) route group (URLs like /auth-test)
- Follow the documentation and use app/poc/* (URLs like /poc/auth-test)
- Introduce a new structure entirely
Decision: Standardized on app/poc/* to follow documentation specification
Rationale:
- Aligns implementation with documented URL pattern (/poc/*)
- Creates consistency between documentation and code
- Follows Next.js routing conventions more clearly
Implications:
- Provides clearer understanding of URL structure
- Makes it easier to navigate the codebase by having consistent naming
- Avoids confusion for future developers
```

```
Decision: Directory Structure and API Route Patterns Alignment
Problem: Project structure didn't fully align with the documented folder structure and API route patterns
Options:
- Keep the existing structure with d365Client in lib/ and API under /api/core/dataverse
- Reorganize to match documentation with d365Client in lib/clients/ and API under /api/dataverse
- Create a hybrid approach with partial reorganization
Decision: Fully align with documented structure
Rationale:
- Creates consistency between documentation and implementation
- Follows established naming conventions and directory structure
- Improves maintainability by making the codebase predictable
- Adheres to the guiding principles of clarity and maintainability
Implications:
- Requires updating imports across the codebase
- May initially break existing routes if not all references are updated
- Establishes a pattern for future code organization
```

```
Decision: POC Directory Naming Standardization
Problem: POC directory names in app/poc/* had inconsistent naming patterns (auth-test, bff-test, styling-test)
Options:
- Keep existing inconsistent naming (auth-test, bff-test, styling-test)
- Standardize on cleaner names without the "-test" suffix (auth, bff, ui)
- Adopt a completely different naming convention
Decision: Standardize on cleaner POC names without the "-test" suffix
Rationale:
- Creates consistency with documentation which references /poc/auth, /poc/ui, etc.
- Makes URLs cleaner and more professional (e.g., /poc/ui instead of /poc/styling-test)
- Establishes a consistent pattern for future POCs (state, leads)
- Better represents the purpose of each POC as a concept demonstration, not just a test
Implications:
- Required updating references in navigation and documentation
- Simplified the URL structure for better usability
- Helps clarify that these are proper Proof-of-Concept modules, not just test pages
```

```
Decision: API URL Pattern Standardization
Problem: The handoff documentation suggests `/api/{domain}/{action}` URLs (e.g., `/api/leads/list`), but the implementation uses RESTful `/api/{domain}` with HTTP methods
Options:
- Switch to action-based URLs as documented (`/api/leads/list`, `/api/leads/create`)
- Maintain RESTful resource-based approach (`/api/leads` with GET, POST, PATCH)
- Implement hybrid approach with both patterns
Decision: Standardize on RESTful resource-based API URLs with HTTP methods
Rationale:
- Aligns with modern REST API best practices
- Improves developer experience through familiar patterns
- Works seamlessly with Next.js API route handlers
- Enables cleaner code organization by grouping related operations
- Follows guiding principles of clarity, maintainability, and modern best practices
Implications:
- Slight deviation from initial documentation, but more aligned with industry standards
- Increased consistency and maintainability across API endpoints
- Better adherence to the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern as specified in architecture
- Requires clear documentation of the API design pattern for developers
```

```
Decision: UI Component Architecture and Data Table Implementation
Problem: Need a consistent and flexible way to build UI components, particularly for complex data tables
Options:
- Use basic shadcn/ui components with custom data table implementation
- Integrate TanStack Table with shadcn/ui for advanced data handling
- Use a third-party data grid component with different styling conventions
Decision: Integrated TanStack Table with shadcn/ui components
Rationale:
- TanStack Table provides powerful data handling features while remaining framework-agnostic
- shadcn/ui components offer consistent styling and accessibility features
- The integration preserves the design system's visual consistency
- Provides advanced features like sorting, filtering, pagination without compromising design
- Follows the project's guiding principles of clarity and modern best practices
Implications:
- Requires additional dependencies to be installed (TanStack Table, various Radix UI primitives)
- Creates a stronger coupling between the UI framework and data management
- Provides a reusable pattern for all data-heavy interfaces in the application
- Establishes a comprehensive approach for the Lead Management Mini-App POC
```

```
Decision: POC Navigation Structure Refinement
Problem: The main POC navigation component (`PocNavigation`) was becoming cluttered with links to sub-pages of individual POCs (e.g., UI POC's Forms, Tables). This made top-level navigation less clear, and sub-pages within complex POCs lacked dedicated, contextual navigation.
Options:
- Option 1: Keep all navigation links (top-level POCs and sub-pages) within the single `PocNavigation` component.
- Option 2: Implement hierarchical/dropdown menus within `PocNavigation` for POCs with sub-pages.
- Option 3: Refine `PocNavigation` to only include top-level POCs and introduce separate sub-navigation components for individual POCs with multiple sections (e.g., for UI POC).
Decision: Implemented Option 3. Refined `PocNavigation` to link only to major POC modules (`/poc/core`, `/poc/auth`, `/poc/ui`, `/poc/bff`). Created a new `UiPocSubNavigation` component for UI POC sub-pages (`/poc/ui`, `/poc/ui/forms`, `/poc/ui/tables`, `/poc/ui/data-display`) and integrated it into the `app/poc/ui/layout.tsx`.
Rationale:
- Clarity & Simplicity: Keeps the main `PocNavigation` clean and focused on high-level POC modules.
- Contextual Navigation: Provides clear, dedicated navigation within complex POCs like the UI POC, improving user experience.
- Maintainability & Scalability: Establishes a modular pattern for handling navigation in POCs that might grow to have multiple sub-sections.
- Adherence to Guiding Principles: Aligns with principles of Clarity, Simplicity, and Maintainability.
Implications:
- Establishes a pattern that can be replicated for other POCs if they develop multiple sub-pages.
- Requires maintaining the `PocNavigation` for top-level navigation and specific sub-navigation components (like `UiPocSubNavigation`) as needed.
- The layout file for POCs with sub-navigation (e.g., `app/poc/ui/layout.tsx`) becomes responsible for rendering the relevant sub-navigation component.
```

```
Decision: Global Navigation Implementation
Problem: POC navigation component was only displayed on POC-specific pages, leading to inconsistent navigation experience across the application
Options:
- Keep navigation POC-specific and create a separate global navigation
- Duplicate navigation component in each layout that needs it
- Move POC navigation to root layout to serve as global navigation
Decision: Moved PocNavigation component to root layout, making it the global navigation
Rationale:
- Simplicity: Single navigation component serves entire application
- Consistency: Users see the same navigation on all pages
- Maintainability: One component to update when navigation changes
- Clarity: Clear navigation available throughout the application
Implications:
- Navigation now appears on all pages including home and auth error pages
- Removed redundant login button from home page
- Future navigation updates only need to be made in one place
- Sets pattern for global UI elements
```

```
Decision: Theme-Specific Logo Switching Architecture
Problem: Need to support different logos based on theme/role but maintain clean code structure
Options:
- Remove logo switching logic entirely until needed
- Keep conditional logic in place for future implementation
- Implement complex role-based switching immediately
Decision: Maintain conditional logo switching structure with placeholders for future implementation
Rationale:
- Scalability: Architecture ready for multi-state/role-based branding
- Forward-thinking: Prevents refactoring when actual logos are available
- Clean implementation: Logic is in place but uses same logo for now
- Aligns with multi-state expansion plans mentioned in project purpose
Implications:
- Code includes conditional logic that currently shows same logo
- When different logos are available (e.g., /tn.svg), only image paths need updating
- Establishes pattern for theme/role-based UI variations
```

```
Decision: State-Specific Theming Implementation Approach
Problem: Need to assign state-specific themes based on user's Dynamics 365 Contact record data without modifying D365 schema
Options:
- Option 1: Create separate D365 fields for states and roles
- Option 2: Use prefix notation in existing role field (e.g., "role:admin,state:arkansas")
- Option 3: Allow mixed values with smart parsing
- Option 4: Store JSON structure in the field
Decision: Implemented prefix-based notation approach (Option 2)
Rationale:
- Simplicity: Easy to understand and configure in D365 without schema changes
- Flexibility: Allows both roles and states in a single field
- Backward Compatibility: Maintains support for unprefixed role values
- Clarity: Clear visual distinction between roles and states
- Scalability: Easy to add new prefixes in the future if needed
Implications:
- D365 administrators must use prefix notation when configuring user access
- Parsing logic required in D365ContactService to separate roles from states
- Documentation needed for D365 field configuration format
- Theme suggestions offered automatically based on state assignments
- Cookie-based theme persistence prevents flash on page loads
```

```
Decision: Simplification of Theme Management to D365 State Exclusivity
Problem: The application included manual theme toggling capabilities and a demo page which were complex, had minor UI issues, and were not aligned with the core requirement of D365 state-driven theming.
Options:
- Debug and fix the ThemeToggle component and maintain manual switching.
- Remove all manual theme toggling, the demo page, and simplify to D365 state-driven theming only.
Decision: Removed all manual theme toggling capabilities, the `/poc/ui/theme-switcher` demo page, and associated UI elements. The application's visual theme is now exclusively determined by the user's D365 state via `StateThemeChecker`.
Rationale:
- Alignment with Core User Story: Primary requirement is D365-driven theming.
- Simplified User Experience: Consistent theme based on D365 context.
- Reduced Code Complexity: Eliminates components/pages for manual toggling.
- Focus on D365 as Source of Truth: Reinforces guiding principles.
- Issue Resolution: Sidesteps minor UI issues with `ThemeToggle` by removing the non-essential feature.
Implications:
- `StateThemeChecker` is the sole driver for programmatic theme changes.
- `ThemeProvider` manages theme state, but `StateThemeChecker` dictates the theme.
- D365 state theme always overrides `localStorage`.
- Codebase related to theme management is significantly simplified.
```

```
Decision: Profile Data Fetching Strategy to Bypass Session Cache
Problem: After updating profile data in D365, the changes were visible immediately but on browser refresh, old cached session data was displayed despite D365 having the updated values.
Options:
- Force session refresh after D365 updates (complex, might require re-authentication)
- Always fetch fresh data from D365 on profile page load
- Implement complex session update mechanisms
- Use only client-side data fetching for profile page
Decision: Implemented client-side fresh data fetching on profile page mount, bypassing the stale session cache
Rationale:
- Simplicity: No complex session manipulation required
- Stability: Always shows current D365 data
- Clarity: Clear data flow from D365 → API → UI
- Security: Still requires authentication via middleware
- User Experience: Added manual refresh button for user control
Implications:
- Profile page always shows latest D365 data
- Small performance trade-off for accuracy (one extra API call on page load)
- Session data remains stale but profile page bypasses it
- Pattern can be applied to other pages needing fresh D365 data
```

```

Decision: State Management, Data Fetching, and Validation Patterns for POC
Problem: To establish clear, scalable, and maintainable patterns for client-side state management, server data interaction, and data validation for the Partner Portal V2.0, as demonstrated in the State Management POC (`/poc/state`).
Options:
- Ad-hoc state management within individual components, leading to potential inconsistencies and difficulties in sharing state.
- Relying solely on React Context API for all global state, which can become complex for managing server cache and frequent updates.
- Using a single, all-encompassing state management library for both server cache and client UI state, potentially leading to a less specialized or overly complex solution for one or both concerns.
- Adopting a combination of specialized, best-in-class libraries for distinct concerns: server state, global client UI state, and local component state, along with dedicated validation libraries.
Decision: Implemented a structured approach using a combination of specialized libraries:
1.  **TanStack Query for Server State Management:**
    *   Handles all interactions with server-side data (fetching lists, creating, updating, deleting items).
    *   Manages caching, background refetching, and request deduplication.
    *   Employs optimistic updates for all mutations to provide a responsive UI, with rollback on error.
    *   Utilizes consistent query key naming (e.g., `['pocItems']`) for effective cache management and invalidation.
2.  **Zod & React Hook Form for Client-Side Validation:**
    *   Zod schemas define data structures and validation rules for forms (e.g., `itemFormSchema`).
    *   React Hook Form integrates with Zod (via `@hookform/resolvers/zod`) for form state management, submission, and clear display of validation errors.
3.  **Zustand for Global Client-Side UI State:**
    *   Manages UI-specific state not persisted on the server but shared across components (e.g., `itemFilter` for list display).
    *   Stores are kept lean and focused on specific domains of state (e.g., `useItemFilterStore`).
4.  **React `useState` for Local Component State:**
    *   Used for state confined to a single component (e.g., `editingItem` in the item list).
Rationale:
-   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Distinct tools for server state, global client state, local state, and validation lead to a more organized and understandable codebase.
-   **Specialized Tooling:** Each library is highly optimized for its specific purpose (e.g., TanStack Query for server caching, Zustand for lightweight global state).
-   **Improved Developer Experience:** Clear patterns make it easier for developers to understand where and how to manage different types of state.
-   **Scalability and Maintainability:** Modular approach facilitates easier testing, debugging, and scaling of the application.
-   **Performance:** Optimistic updates and efficient caching (TanStack Query) and lightweight global state (Zustand) contribute to a responsive user experience.
Implications:
-   Developers should adhere to these established patterns when implementing new features requiring state management or data interaction.
-   New Zustand stores should be created for new domains of global client UI state, keeping them focused.
-   TanStack Query should be the default for all server-side data operations.
-   Zod schemas should be defined for all form data and API payloads/responses where applicable.
-   Requires understanding of these specific libraries, but the benefits in structure and maintainability outweigh the initial learning curve.
